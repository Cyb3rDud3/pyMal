what I want to achieve here:

    metamorphic malware that should recompile the pyinstaller bootloader with obfuscation from my other module, 
    obfuscate it's own source code, then use the modified pyinstaller to create single exe from the whole obfuscated thing,
    while making sure to avoid vms and avs, maintaining access, and exploiting other hostes in the victim network.
    this should be metamorphic and the exe created should do JUST the same but with HEAVY changes in the source code.
    the EXE created should be as far as possible from the original one, and we are gonna achieve it by obfuscating the pyinstaller bootloader.
    this module is not done and i have a LOT to do, feel free to contribute
