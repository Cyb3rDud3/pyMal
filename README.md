what i want to do here:
metamorphic malware that should recompile the pyinstaller bootloader with obfuscation for my other module, obfuscate it's own source code (which is stored as base64 of zip of this whole repo), then use the modified pyinstaller to create single exe from the whole obfuscated things, while making sure to avoid vm's and av's. this should be metamorphic and the exe created should do JUST the same but with changes in the code from the obfuscation.
this module is not done and i have a LOT to do, feel free to contribute

anyfolder/backup --> source code of cython modules!

PLEASE DO NOT USE FOR ANY MALICIOUS INTENTIONS, THIS PROJECT CREATED FOR RESEARCH ONLY, AND BASED ON THE CONCEPT FOUND BY https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00565.pdf
AS THIS IS POC WITH NO BAD INTENTIONS --> WE ARE NOT GONNA "ENABLE" ANY BAD FUNCTIONALITY HERE! ONLY WRITING IT, NOT CALLING!

קופה ראשית.
